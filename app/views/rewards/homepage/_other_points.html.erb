			<h4>Mini yet &ldquo;Power&rdquo;ful</h4>
			<p>A little longer than a quarter (1.85 in), Linquet is very tiny. It’s just 0.98 in x thickness 0.19 in (47 mm X 25 mm x 5 mm)
				yet even with 24/7 usage and an alarm loud enough even for outdoor environments, its battery lasts up to 1 year! It’ll even
				notify you when it’s running low and you could easily pop it open and replace its commonly found coin cell battery.</p>
