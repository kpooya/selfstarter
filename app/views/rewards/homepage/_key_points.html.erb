        Never again misplace or lose your phone, keys, wallet, pet, ...
      </h3>
      <p>
        Prevent the loss or theft of your phone and valuables.  Simply attach a Linquet to your valuable and link it to your phone
        through our free app. When the phone or any valuable goes out-of-range (e.g. leaving home without your wallet) BOTH your phone
        and your valuable will alarm, PREVENTING you from forgetting/losing your stuff. Also, Linquet uploads both time and location to
        the cloud, enabling you to find your phone and valuables afterwards.
