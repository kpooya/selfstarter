        Never again misplace or lose your phone, keys, wallet, pet, ...
      </h3>
      <p>
        Prevent the loss or theft of your phone and valuables.  Simply attach a Linquet to your valuable and link it to your phone
        through our free app. When the phone or any valuable goes out-of-range (e.g. leaving home without your wallet), BOTH your phone
        and your valuable will alarm, PREVENTING you from forgetting/losing your stuff. Also, Linquet uploads both time and location to
        the cloud, enabling you to find your phone and valuables afterwards.

        Imagine if you never again forget your phone at the office, misplace the car keys before a meeting or find out your beloved puppy
        has wandered off. Imagine how much easier, more relaxed and more productive your life would be. Wouldn’t that be amazing?

        Cloud-based solution
      </h3>
      <p>
        Linquet is the first cloud-based solution out there. It provides users with unique powerful features such as phone tracking,
        unlimited updates, post-loss, maps, My Profiles and etc. It also has a powerful programmable button which allows users to
        find their phone (even when it’s on silent) or use it for other cool things like Panic button, Camera controller,
        temperature sensor and etc.
